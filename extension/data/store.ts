This is separate from the `locales` directory of the theme, which makes it a useful feature for sections that are meant to be installed on multiple themes or shops.\n\nThe `locales` object has the following general format:\n\n```json\n\n{\n  \"locales\": {\n    \"language\": {\n      \"translation_key\": \"translation_value\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Example**\n\n```liquid\n\n{% schema %}\n{\n  \"name\": \"Slideshow\",\n  \"class\": \"slideshow\",\n  \"settings\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"id\": \"title\",\n      \"label\": \"Slideshow\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"locales\": {\n    \"en\": {\n      \"title\": \"Slideshow\"\n    },\n    \"fr\": {\n      \"title\": \"Diaporama\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n{% endschema %}\n\n```\n\nAny translations will show up under the Sections tab of the language editor for merchants to edit. When edits are made, the changes are saved directly to the applicable locale file, and the section schema is unchanged.\n\nThese translations can be accessed through the Liquid [translation filter](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/filters/translate) (`t` filter) where the key will be in the following format:\n\n```\nsections.[section-name].[translation-description]\n```\n\nFor example, if you want to reference the title translation from the example above, then use the following:\n\n```liquid\n{{ 'sections.slideshow.title' | t }}\n```\n\n#\n\n---\n\n[Shopify Documentation](https://shopify.dev/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema#locales)\n","properties":{"af":{"type":"object","description":"Afrikaans (Afrikaans)"},"ar":{"type":"object","description":"Arabic (العربية)"},"az":{"type":"object","description":"Azerbaijani (Azərbaycan­lı)"},"be":{"type":"object","description":"Belarusian (беларуская)"},"bg":{"type":"object","description":"Bulgarian (български)"},"bs":{"type":"object","description":"Bosnian (bosanski/босански)"},"cs":{"type":"object","description":"Czech (čeština)"},"cy":{"type":"object","description":"Welsh (Cymraeg)"},"da":{"type":"object","description":"Danish (dansk)"},"de":{"type":"object","description":"German (Deutsch)"},"el":{"type":"object","description":"Greek (ελληνικά)"},"en":{"type":"object","description":"English"},"es":{"type":"object","description":"Spanish (español)"},"et":{"type":"object","description":"Estonian (eesti)"},"fa":{"type":"object","description":"Persian (فارسى)"},"fi":{"type":"object","description":"Finnish (suomi)"},"fr":{"type":"object","description":"French (français)"},"fy":{"type":"object","description":"Frisian (Frysk)"},"he":{"type":"object","description":"Hebrew (עברית)"},"hr":{"type":"object","description":"Croatian (hrvatski)"},"hi":{"type":"object","description":"Hindi (हिंदी)"},"hu":{"type":"object","description":"Hungarian (magyar)"},"id":{"type":"object","description":"Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)"},"is":{"type":"object","description":"Icelandic (íslenska)"},"lv":{"type":"object","description":"Latvian (latviešu)"},"nl":{"type":"object","description":"Dutch (Nederlands)"},"no":{"type":"object","description":"Norwegian (norsk)"},"it":{"type":"object","description":"Italian (italiano)"},"ja":{"type":"object","description":"Japanese (日本語)"},"ko":{"type":"object","description":"Korean (한국어/韓國語)"},"lb":{"type":"object","description":"Luxembourgish (Lëtzebuergesch)"},"lt":{"type":"object","description":"Lithuanian (lietuvių)"},"mk":{"type":"object","description":"Macedonian (македонски јазик)"},"pa":{"type":"object","description":"Punjabi (ਪੰਜਾਬੀ)"},"pl":{"type":"object","description":"Polish (polski)"},"pt":{"type":"object","description":"Portuguese (Português)"},"ro":{"type":"object","description":"Romanian (română)"},"ru":{"type":"object","description":"Russian (русский)"},"si":{"type":"object","description":"Sinhala (සිංහල)"},"sl":{"type":"object","description":"Albanian (shqipe)"},"sk":{"type":"object","description":"Slovak (slovenčina)"},"sq":{"type":"object","description":"Slovenian (slovenski)"},"sv":{"type":"object","description":"Swedish (svenska)"},"ta":{"type":"object","description":"Tamil (தமிழ்)"},"th":{"type":"object","description":"Thai (ไทย)"},"tr":{"type":"object","description":"Turkish (Türkçe)"},"zh":{"type":"object","description":"Chinese (中文)"},"uk":{"type":"object","description":"Ukrainian (українська)"},"vi":{"type":"object","description":"Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt/㗂越)"}}},"tag":{"title":"Tag","markdownDescription":"By default, when Shopify renders a section, it’s wrapped in a `<div>` element with a unique id attribute:\n\n```html\n\n<div id=\"shopify-section-[id]\" class=\"shopify-section\">\n  <!-- Output of the section content -->\n</div>\n\n```\n\nIf you don’t want to use a `<div>`, then you can specify which kind of HTML element to use with the tag attribute.
