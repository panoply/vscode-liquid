### 11ty Support

This release ships completions support for the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator. Projects can now take advantage of these awesome capabilities:

- File Completions for `includes` and `layouts`
- Data File Components for `data` files.
- Eleventy Supplied Data Completions
- Frontmatter Completions per-file level.

When working on an 11ty project, set the `engine` in your `.liquidrc` file to `11ty` and provide the necessary file globs. Only `.json` files are supported for `data` references.
